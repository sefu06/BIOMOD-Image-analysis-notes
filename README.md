# BIOMOD-Image-analysis-notes
Image analysis labs done in BIOMOD, with my annotations.

## For reference to create virtual environments:

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
deactivate -> to leave the virtual environment

Installing packages:
pip list â†’ shows the packages that are already installed
pip install packagename

For Future Uses:
If the first time, put all packages needed into a txt file:
pip freeze > requirements.txt

Now others can easily install all packages needed at once, with the text file:
pip install -r requirements.txt
